ANSWERS

1)	All measurements for latency using Pinger were found to have a difference of less than 10%

2)	Average Latency for L1 = 86
Average Latency for L2 = 23
Average Latency for L3  = 63 

Adding all three comes to 172

When I sent 20 packets between h1 and h4 we got the following result. 
Min Latency = 164
Max Latency = 172
Average Latency = 165 
No. of packets lost = 6

Thus, it shows that as predicted the average latency is under 10% of 174
