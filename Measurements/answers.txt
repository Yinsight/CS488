Q2: Path Latency and Throughput

The expected latency of the path between h1 and h4 should be the sum of all links in between: L1 + L2 + L3 = 81.462 + 21.056 + 61.165 = 163.683 ms

The expected throughput of the path between h1 and h4 should be close to the minimum throughput among the links in between, which is 24 Mbps.

Average RTT:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19022ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 161.230/162.367/163.918/0.797 ms

Measured throughput:
Sent = 57269Kb rate = 22Mbps

The predictions are correct.

Q3: Effects of Multiplexing

The expected latency for 2 pairs should be about 162ms, because the links used are the same in Q2.
The expected throughput for 2 pairs should be about 12 Mbps, because since there are 2 pairs communicating at the same time, the throughput should be 1/2 of the minimum throughput among the links in between.
The expected latency for 3 pairs should be about 162ms, because the links used are the same in Q2.
The expected throughput for 3 pairs should be about 8 Mbps, because since there are 3 pairs communicating at the same time, the throughput should be 1/3 of the minimum throughput among the links in between.

Average RTT for 2 pairs:
h1-h4:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19024ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.925/162.623/169.079/1.877 ms
h7-h9:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19026ms           
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 161.106/162.496/167.240/1.387 ms

The prediction is correct.

Measured throughput for 2 pairs:
h1-h4:
Sent = 49192Kb rate = 19Mbps
h7-h9:
Sent = 13555Kb rate = 5Mbps

Explanation: 
Although each throughput is not equal to 12Mbps as predicted, they add up tp 24 Mbps, which is equal to the minimum throughput among the links in between.
The prediction is a little off because the throughput is not always equally divided.


Average RTT and measured throughput for 3 pairs:
h1-h4:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19008ms              
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 161.443/163.398/170.008/1.812 ms
h7-h9:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19023ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.948/162.796/170.633/2.116 ms
h10-h8:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19026ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 161.149/162.834/170.085/2.053 ms

The prediction is correct.

Measured throughput for 3 pairs:
h1-h4:
Sent = 23720Kb rate = 9Mbps
h7-h9:
Sent = 27167Kb rate = 10Mbps
h10-h8:
Sent = 13892Kb rate = 5Mbps

Explanation: 
Each throughput are close to 8Mbps as predicted, and they add up tp 24 Mbps, which is equal to the minimum throughput among the links in between.
The prediction is a little off because the throughput is not always equally divided.

Q4: Effects of Multiplexing

The expected latency of the path between h1 and h4 should be close to the sum of all links in between: L1 + L2 + L3 = 81.462 + 21.056 + 61.165 = 163.683 ms
The expected latency of the path between h5 and h6 should be close to the sum of all links in between: L4 + L2 + L5 = 11.260 + 21.056 + 11.233 = 43.549 ms

The expected throughput of the path between h1 and h4 should be less than 24 Mbps, which is the minimum throughput of the links in between, since L2 is used by both communications.
The expected throughput of the path between h5 and h6 should be less than 28 Mbps, which is the minimum throughput of the links in between, since L2 is used by both communications.

Average RTT:
h1-h4:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19021ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 161.017/163.721/170.567/2.118 ms

h5-h6:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19028ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 41.393/42.665/48.811/1.772 ms

The predictions are correct.

Measured throughput:
h1-h4:
Sent = 44293Kb rate = 17Mbps

h5-h6:
Sent = 67454Kb rate = 26Mbps

The predictions are correct. Both throughputs are less than the minimum throughput of the links in between. This is because L2 is shared by both communications.
