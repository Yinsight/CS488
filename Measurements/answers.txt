Q2: Path Latency and Throughput

The expected latency of the path between h1 and h4 should be the sum of all links in between: L1 + L2 + L3 = 81.462 + 21.056 + 61.165 = 163.683 ms

The expected throughput of the path between h1 and h4 is the minimum throughput among the links in between, which is 24 Mbps.

Average RTT:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19022ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 161.230/162.367/163.918/0.797 ms

Measured throughput:
Sent = 57269Kb rate = 22Mbps

The predictions are correct.

Q3: Effects of Multiplexing

The expected latency for 2 pairs should be about 162ms, because the links used are the same in Q2.
The expected throughput for 2 pairs should be about 12 Mbps, because since there are 2 pairs communicating at the same time, the throughput should be 1/2 of the minimum throughput among the links in between.
The expected latency for 3 pairs should be about 162ms, because the links used are the same in Q2.
The expected throughput for 3 pairs should be about 8 Mbps, because since there are 3 pairs communicating at the same time, the throughput should be 1/3 of the minimum throughput among the links in between.

Average RTT for 2 pairs:
h1-h4:
20 packets transmitted, 20 received, 0% packet loss, time 19024ms

Q4: Effects of Multiplexing

The expected latency of the path between h1 and h4 should be the sum of all links in between: L1 + L2 + L3 = 81.462 + 21.056 + 61.165 = 163.683 ms
The expected latency of the path between h5 and h6 should be the sum of all links in between: L4 + L2 + L5 = 11.260 + 21.056 + 11.233 = 43.549
